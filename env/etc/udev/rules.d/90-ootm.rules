# udev rule pattern
# Keys:
#   <KEY_*>     one of predefined udev constants
#   <*_value>   user-defined values which affect udev behavior
# Operations:
#   ==, !=      comparison: rule will be applied if all such operations return 'true'
#   =, +=, :=   assignment: if rule is applied corresponding values are assigned and 
#                           thus will affect further udev behavior
