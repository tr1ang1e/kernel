Tests are done to control that changes might be done
in development environment or sdk-like common module
or in examples itself will not cause examples become
broken. Tests are simple and make just limited set of
operations over the examples:
    - build module
    - run it
    - check if it does required work
    - stop it
    - remove build artifacts


To run all tests execute: 
    $ ./run.sh


To run single test:
    $ cd <example_dir>
    $ ./test.sh


To create test for new example just create file
in the new example dir:
    > name it 'test.sh'
    > make it executable (chmod +x test.sh)


Special script 'error.sh' in current directory
provides constants for specify errors codes and
their string representations - as well as - set
of simple functions to control execution flow:    
    - check_result()    // main function to check single shell command return code
    - crcb_*()          // check result callback = called from check_result() if return code != 0
