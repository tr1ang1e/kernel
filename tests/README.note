Tests are done to control that changes might be done
in development environment or sdk-like common module
or in examples itself will not cause examples become
broken. Tests are simple and make just limited set of
operations over the examples:
    - build module
    - run it
    - check if it does required work
    - stop it
    - remove build artifacts


Usage
    $ cd ROOT/tests/        necessary
    $ ./run.sh              run all tests inside ROOT/src/*/ directories
    $ ./run.sh <dir>        run singe test inside ROOT/src/<dir>/


To create test for new example just create file
in the new example dir:
    > name it 'test.sh'
    > make it executable (chmod +x test.sh)
Template might be found in ROOT/src/template/


Special script 'errcode.sh' in current directory
provides constants for specify errors codes and
their string representations.
